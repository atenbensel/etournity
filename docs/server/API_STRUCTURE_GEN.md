# API File Structure Generation

When adding a new model to the `schema.prisma`, you might find yourself being annoyed at all the steps you have to go through to add the model resolvers to the `/packages/server/src/api` folder. To alleviate the great stress that comes with repetitive tasks like this one, theres now a new solution: `yarn model:add` ðŸŽ‰

With `yarn model:add` ðŸŽ‰ you can:

- generate files and folders with the name of the model automatically
- not be stressed

## How to use it?

Simply type `yarn model:add` into your favorite terminal or terminal emulator and enter the name of the model you want to add to the api. With the power of god and anime, `yarn model:add` ðŸŽ‰ will add folders and files with the name of the model.

## Not satisfied with the results?

Sucks to be you! If you want to change the name of the files that get generated by `yarn model:add` ðŸŽ‰ or their content, you can change the templates in the `scripts/templates` folder. A `*` in the file name will be replaced by the name of the model.
To change the content of the templates, `%Object` and `%object` will be replaced by the `title case` and `lower case` model name respectively.
