# This file is used to define graph types that only exist locally.
# This schema will be merged with the backend schema when running codegen to generate all necessary types.

# Declare new types used with @client here
type authInfo {
  authenticated: Boolean!
  expires: DateTime!
  userId: String!
}

# Merge newly declared types with the base Query type
extend type Query {
  authInfo: authInfo!
}
